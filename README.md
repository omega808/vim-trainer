Description:
        Basically a program to help the user memorize various vim shortcuts. I wrote this program to have a random pratice test to go through every day, 
        to help get VIM in my muscle memory. 

Usage:
        chmod 755 vim-trainer.py
        python3 vim-trainer.py

[*]Note: for optimal use, use in a split pane tmux session. The program running on one pane, and some test
file to edit.
